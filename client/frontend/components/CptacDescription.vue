    <p>NCI supported <a target="_blank"  href="https://proteomics.cancer.gov/programs/cptac">Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC)</a>,
        is a comprehensive and coordinated effort to accelerate the understanding of the molecular
        basis of cancer through the application of large-scale proteome (proteins) and genome (DNA and RNA)
        analysis technologies to different cancer types. CPTAC is composed of expertise in proteomics, genomics,
        cancer biology, oncology, and clinical chemistry, while creating open community resources that
      are widely used by the cancer community.</p>
      <p>Through collaboration with leaders in the field, CPTAC’s mission is to accelerate
        precision oncology through state-of-the-art proteogenomics and create open-source community
        resources. The <a target="_blank" href="https://cbttc.org/">Children’s Brain Tumor Tissue Consortium (CBTTC)</a> is also
        a collaborative, multi-institutional research program dedicated to the study and
        treatment of childhood brain tumors. The CBTTC supports the research of new prognostic
        biomarkers and therapies for children with pediatric brain tumors.</p>
